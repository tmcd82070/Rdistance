#' @title RdistDf - Makes a Rdistance nested data frame
#' 
#' @description Make an Rdistance data frame from 
#' separate transect and distance 
#' data frames. Rdistance data frames are nested 
#' and contain the following information:
#' \itemize{
#'   \item \bold{transects}: Groups of observations on the same transect, plus
#'       id, length, and potentially covariates. (rows)
#'   \item \bold{distanced}: Observation distances and potentially covariates.
#'       (in a list column)
#'   \item \bold{distance types}: Either perpendicular (line-transects) 
#'       or radial (point-transects). (an attribute)
#'   \item \bold{observer type}: Either single observer or multiple observers.
#'   (an attribute)
#' }
#' 
#' @param transectDf A data frame containing attributes of transects. 
#' At a minimum, this data frame must contain the transect's ID (so 
#' it can be merged with \code{detectionDf}) and the transect's length.  
#' All observations are made on a transect, but not all transects necessarily have 
#' observations.  Line-transects are continuous paths wherein targets can 
#' be sighted at any point.  Point transects
#' consist of one or more discrete points from which observers search for targets. 
#' The length of a line-transect is it's physical length in 2D space.
#' The 'length' of a point transect is 
#' the number of points along the transect. A single 
#' point is considered a transect of length one.
#'  
#' @param detectionDf A data frame containing information about the observations
#' on each transect.  At a minimum, this data frame must contain 
#' observation distances and transect ID (so it can merge with \code{transectDf}).
#' Observation level covariates are included in this data frame.  
#' 
#' @param pointSurvey If TRUE, observations were
#' made from discrete points (i.e., during a point-transect survey) and distances 
#' are radial from observation point to target.  If FALSE, 
#' observations were made along a continuous transect 
#' (i.e., during a line-transect survey) and distances are from target to nearest 
#' point on the transect (i.e., perpendicular to transect).
#'    
#' @param observer Type of observer system.  Legal values are \bold{"single"} for 
#' single observer systems, \bold{"1given2"} for a double observer system 
#' wherein observations 
#' made by observer 1 are tested against observations made by observer 2,
#' \bold{"2given1"} for a double observer system wherein observations 
#' made by observer 2 are tested against observations made by observer 1, and
#' \bold{"both"} for a double observer system wherein observations 
#' made by both observers are tested against the other and combined.
#' 
#' @param .distanceCol Name of the list column in returned object 
#' containing distances. 
#' 
#' @param by A character vector of variables to join by.
#' If NULL, the default, \code{RdistDf}‚Å† will perform a
#' natural join, using all variables in common between
#' \code{transectDf} and \code{detectionDf}. To join on 
#' specific variables, specify a character vector of 
#' variable names to join by. For example, by = c("a", "b") 
#' joins \code{transectDf$a} to \code{detectionDf$a} and 
#' \code{transectDf$b} to \code{detectionDf$b}. If variable names 
#' differ between \code{transectDf} and \code{detectionDf}, 
#' use a named character vector like by = c("a" = "b", 
#' "c" = "d") which joins \code{transectDf$a} to 
#' \code{detectionDf$b} and 
#' \code{transectDf$c} to \code{detectionDf$d}. 
#' 
#' @return A nested dataframe with one row per transect and observation information  
#' in a list column.  Technically, the return is 
#' a \code{tibble} from 
#' the \code{tibble} package with a list column containing 
#' distance information. Survey type and observer system are recorded 
#' as attributes (\code{transType} and \code{obsType}, respecfully).
