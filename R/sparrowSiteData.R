#' @description  
#' Line transect data from 72 transects located in central Wyoming, each 500 meters long,
#' surveyed for Brewer's Sparrows by Dr. Jason Carlisle of the Wyoming Cooperative Fish & Wildlife
#' Research Unit in 2012. 
#' See the package vignettes for tutorials of the basic analysis.

#' @docType data
#' 
#' @format A data.frame containing 72 rows and 8 columns.  Each row represents
#' a site (transect) surveyed.  Column descriptions: 
#' 
#' \enumerate{ 
#'   \item \code{siteID}: Factor (72 levels), the site or transect surveyed.  
#'   \item \code{length}: Number, the length (m) of each transect.  
#'   \item \code{observer}: Factor (five levels), identity of the observer 
#'   who surveyed the transect.
#'   \item \code{bare}: Number, the mean bare ground cover (\%) within 100 m of each transect.
#'   \item \code{herb}: Number, the mean herbaceous cover (\%) within 100 m of
#'   each transect.
#'   \item \code{shrub}: Number, the mean shrub cover (\%) within
#'   100 m of each transect.
#'   \item \code{height}: Number, the mean shrub height 
#'   (cm) within 100 m of each transect.
#'   \item \code{shrubclass}: Factor (two levels), shrub class is "Low"" when 
#'   shrub cover is < 10\%, "High" otherwise.
