#' @title Compute off-transect distances from sighting distances and angles
#' 
#' @description Computes off-transect (also called 'perpendicular') distances from measures of sighting distance and sighting angle.
#' 
#' @param sightDist Character, name of column in \code{data} that contains the observed or sighting distances from the observer to the detected objects.
#' @param sightAngle Character, name of column in \code{data} that contains the observed or sighting angles from the line transect to the detected 
#'   objects.  Angles must be measured in degrees.
#' @param data data.frame object containing sighting distance and sighting angle.
#' 
#' @details If observers recorded sighting distance and sighting angle (as is often common in line transect surveys), use this function to convert 
#'   to off-transect distances, the required input data for \code{dfunc.estim}.
#' @return A vector of off-transect (or perpendicular) distances.  Units are the same as \code{sightDist}.
