This is where you are:

## Need to test:  
1.    [DONE]presence of covariates (point and line)
2.    [DONE] Testing methods for Point surveys (start with x_test_points_noCovars.R maybe)
3.    Test methods for all the options in controls$ esp $requireunits
4.    Test methods for by.site = T in abundEstim
5.    [DELAY] Test methods that compare to past values, not just for presence of output
6.    [DONE] Test file for different units to check equality. e.g., set w.hi = "100 m" then w.hi = 100 m in ft and check that answers are same.

## Need To Do:
1.    Remove requirement of no missing values from `abundEstim`. Missing distances 
in detection data frame are okay. But, we stop when missing distances show up 
in `abundEstim`. 
2.    Include one numerical integration routine.  Maybe use R::integrate().
Call this routine from integration.constant() and ESW().  Upgrade to 
Simpson's alternate composite formula. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_rule

(dx/48) * (17f(x_0) + 59f(x_1) + 43f(x_2) + 49f(x_3) + 48f(x_4) + 48f(x_5) + ...
          + 48f(x_n-4) + 49f(x_n-3) + 43f(x_n-2) + 59f(x_n-1) + 17f(x_n))

3.    In addition to the above, you know the integral of several likelihoods. 
Integral of halfnormal is 0.5*sigma*sqrt(pi).  I think you can work out integral 
of negative exponential. Use numerical integration for the others. 
4.    Consolidate the help using @inherit methods
