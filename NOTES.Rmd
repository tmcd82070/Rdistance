Notes and to-do for `s6methods` branch of Rdistance:

# Package Notes:

3.    _Note_: You use Simpsons 1/3 composite rule in version >4.0.0.  Study precision differences between it and
Simpson's alternate composite formula. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Simpson's_rule
$$
(dx/48) * (17f(x_0) + 59f(x_1) + 43f(x_2) + 49f(x_3) + 48f(x_4) + 48f(x_5) + ...
          + 48f(x_n-4) + 49f(x_n-3) + 43f(x_n-2) + 59f(x_n-1) + 17f(x_n))
$$
3.    Consider completely separate function flow for Gamma and smooth likelihoods. 
4.    _Circles in plots_ : At present, covariates associated with distances are not used to plot circles. This means if distance i is from observer 1, it will get plotted on all drawn distance functions including those from observer 2 or 3.  Consider fixing this and only plot distances from observations associated with covariates being plotted. That is, figure out which observations are associated with the requested covariate classes in `newdata`. If you do this, you could also plot bars associated with the covariate classes. This is complicated because you will need to tidyr::unite covariate values in the `newdata` and the `model.matrix` and figure out which rows from `model.matrix` are associated with which rows in `newdata`.  Factors are easy.  For numeric covariates, you can say a distance is associated with a numeric value of X if it is within 1 standard deviation of X. 
5.    _Testing Versus Distance_: Check parameter values and log likelihoods of every likelihood against what `distance` gives. 
7.    _Two param likelihoods_: At some stage, after Rdistance is out, consider including two equations for parameters of likelihoods with two parameters.  E.g., one formula for 'beta' of Huber likelihood and another for 'gamma', e.g., `beta ~ observer` and `gamma ~ observer`. I think this will require a whole new estimation function. 
8.    _Gamma likelihood_: Add the Gamma likelihood back into the package.  You took out Gamma at version 4.0.0.
1.    _Logistic, Uniform, Triangle, and Huber Likelihoods_: Implement logistic and uniform likelihoods.  You took them out of version 4.0.0. I think you need to use the EM algorithm. See next note. You placed the old versions in `CodeParkingLot/OtherLikelihoods`.


9.  *Stepwise variable selection*: Write `add1` and `drop1` and `extractAIC` so that `step` function will work with distance function objects. 


# Testing:

You have most of these testing files drafted in `Rdistance/CodeParkingLot/tests/version3.1.1`.


3.    Test methods for all the options (those set in `onLoad`)
4.    Test methods for `type = density` in `predict(dfunc)`
7.    Tests that check against `distance::ds` and other routines.  This should become a vignette or paper. 
8.    Test NA distances in data set.  These should not appear in the distance function but the observation (groupsize) should count toward abundance.
9.    Test NA transect lengths.  These should contribute distance observations, but not count toward abundance. 

# Missing values:

Missing values in an observation contribute to either distance function estimation ('dfunc') or abundance estimation ('abundance') as follows: 

```{r table2, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warnings=FALSE, results='asis'}
tabl <- "

Group size values never contribute to distance function estimation. Distance functions are estimated from distances only.
