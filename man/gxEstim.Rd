\usage{
gxEstim(fit)
}
\arguments{
\item{fit}{An estimated \code{dfunc} object.  See \code{dfuncEstim}.}
}
\value{
A list comprised of the following components:
  \item{x.scl}{The value of x (distance) at which g() is evaluated.  }
  \item{comp2 }{The estimated value of g() when evaluated at \code{x.scl}.  }
}
\description{
Estimate distance function scaling factor
, g(0) or g(x), for a specified distance function.
}
\details{
This routine scales sightability such that 
g(\code{x.scl}) = \code{g.x.scl}, where g() is the sightability function.
Specification of \code{x.scl} and \code{g.x.scl} covers several estimation cases:
\enumerate{  
  \item \bold{g(0) = 1} : (the default) Inputs are \code{x.scl} = 0, \code{g.x.scl} = 1. 
  If \code{w.lo} > 0, \code{x.scl} will be set to \code{w.lo}
  so technically this case is g(\code{w.low}) = 1.
  
  \item \bold{User supplied probability at specified distance}: Inputs are 
  \code{x.scl} = a number greater than or equal 
  to \code{w.lo}, \code{g.x.scl} = a number between 0 and 1.  This case 
  covers situations where sightability on the transect (distance 0) is 
  not perfect.  This case  assumes researchers have an independent 
  estimate of sightability at distance 
  \code{x.scl} off the transect.  For example, researchers could be
  using multiple 
  observers to estimate that sightability at distance \code{x.scl} 
  is \code{g.x.scl}. 
  
  \item \bold{Maximum sightability specified}: Inputs 
  are \code{x.scl}="max", \code{g.x.scl} =  a number 
  between 0 and 1.  In this case, 
  g() is scaled such that its maximum value is \code{g.x.scl}.  
  This routine computes the distance at which g() is maximum, sets 
  g()'s height there to \code{g.x.scl}, and returns \code{x.max} where 
  x.max is the distance at which g is maximized. This case covers the 
  common aerial survey situation where maximum sightability is slightly 
  off the transect, but the distance at which the maximum occurs 
  is unknown. 
  
  \item \bold{Double observer system}: Inputs are 
  \code{x.scl}="max", \code{g.x.scl} = <a data frame>. 
  In this case, g(\emph{x}) = \emph{h}, where \emph{x} is the distance that 
  maximizes g and \emph{h} is the height of g() at \emph{x} 
  computed from the double observer data frame (see below for 
  structure of the double observer data frame).
  
  
  \item \bold{Distance of independence specified, height computed from double 
  observer system}: Inputs are 
  \code{x.scl} = a number greater than or equal to \code{w.lo}
  \code{g.x.scl} = a data frame.  In this case, g(\code{x.scl}) = \emph{h}, 
  where \emph{h} is computed from the double observer data frame 
  (see below for structure of the double observer data frame). 

}   
  
  When \code{x.scl}, \code{g.x.scl}, or \code{observer} are NULL, the routine 
  will look for and use \code{$call.x.scl}, or \code{$call.g.x.scl}, or 
  \code{$call.observer} components of the \code{fit} object for whichever 
  of these three parameters is missing.  Later, different 
  values can be specified in a direct call to \code{F.gx.estim} 
  without having to re-estimate the distance function. Because of this feature, 
  the default values in \code{dfuncEstim} are \code{x.scl} = 0 and 
  \code{g.x.scl} = 1 and \code{observer} = "both".

\section{Structure of the double observer data frame}{
  
When \code{g.x.scl} is a data frame, it is assumed to contain 
  the components \code{$obsby.1} and \code{$obsby.2} (no flexibility on names). 
  Each row in the data frame contains data from one sighted target. 
  The \code{$obsby.1} and \code{$obsby.2} components are 
  TRUE/FALSE (logical) vectors indicating whether 
  observer 1 (\code{obsby.1}) or observer 2 (\code{obsby.2}) spotted the target.
