\usage{
abundEstim(
  object,
  area = NULL,
  propUnitSurveyed = 1,
  ci = 0.95,
  R = 500,
  plot.bs = FALSE,
  showProgress = TRUE,
  parallel = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An Rdistance model frame or fitted distance function,
normally produced by a call to \code{\link{dfuncEstim}}.}

\item{area}{A scalar containing the total area of inference. Usually, this is 
study area size.  If \code{area} is NULL (the default), 
\code{area} will be set to 1 square unit of the output units and density estimates
will be produced. 
If \code{area} is not NULL, it must have measurement units 
assigned by the \code{units} package. 
The units on \code{area} must be convertible
to squared output units. Units 
on \code{area} must be two-dimensional. 
For example, if output units are "foo", 
units on area must be convertible to "foo^2" by the \code{units}
package. Units of "km^2", "cm^2", "ha", "m^2", "acre", "mi^2", and several
others are acceptable.}

\item{propUnitSurveyed}{A scalar or vector of real numbers between 0 and 1.
The proportion of the default sampling unit that 
  was surveyed.  If both sides of line transects were observed, 
  \code{propUnitSurveyed}
  = 1.  If only a single side of line transects were observed, set 
  \code{propUnitSurveyed} = 0.5. For point transects, this should be set to 
  the proportion of each circle that was observed. Length must either be
  1 or the total number of transects in \code{x}.}

\item{ci}{A scalar indicating the confidence level of confidence intervals. 
Confidence intervals are computed using a bias corrected bootstrap
method. If \code{ci = NULL} or \code{ci == NA}, confidence intervals 
are not computed.}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap iterations to conduct when \code{ci} is not
NULL.}

\item{plot.bs}{A logical scalar indicating whether to plot individual
bootstrap iterations.}

\item{showProgress}{A logical indicating whether to show a text-based
progress bar during bootstrapping. Default is \code{TRUE}. 
It is handy to shut off the 
progress bar if running this within another function. Otherwise, 
it is handy to see progress of the bootstrap iterations.}

\item{parallel}{A logical or positive integer, ignored unless 
confidence intervals are requested (i.e., \code{!is.null(ci)}).
If TRUE, bootstrap confidence interval iterations are 
run in parallel using the maximum number of available cores minus 1. 
The maximum number of cores is reported by \code{parallel::detectCores()}.
If a positive integer (1 <= \code{parallel} <= maximum cores), bootstrap 
iterations are performed in parallel on that many cores. 
If FALSE, bootstrap iterations are performed in series, and progress 
will be shown if \code{showProgress == TRUE}. Parameters 
\code{showProgress} and \code{plot.bs} are ignored when operating
in parallel.}
}
\value{
An Rdistance 'abundance estimate' object, which is a list of
  class \code{c("abund", "dfunc")}, containing all the components of a "dfunc"
  object (see \code{\link{dfuncEstim}}), plus the following: 
  
  \item{estimates}{A tibble containing fitted coefficients in the
  distance function, density in the area(s) surveyed, 
  abundance on the study area, the number of groups seen 
  between w.lo and w.hi, the number 
  of individuals seen between w.lo and w.hi, 
  study area size, surveyed area, average group size, and 
  average effective detection distance.
  }
  
  \item{B}{If confidence intervals were requested, a tibble 
  containing all bootstrap values of coefficients, 
  density, abundance, groups seen, individuals seen, 
  study area size, surveyed area size, average group size, 
  and average effective detection distance.  The number of rows is always 
  \code{R}, the requested number of bootstrap 
  iterations.  If an iteration fails, the
  corresponding row in \code{B} is \code{NA} (hence, use 'na.rm = TRUE' 
  when computing summaries). Columns 1 through \code{length(coef(dfunc))}
  contain bootstrap realizations of the distance function's coefficients. 
  }
  
  \item{ci}{Confidence level of the confidence intervals}
}
\description{
Estimate abundance (or density) from an estimated detection
  function and supplemental information on observed group sizes, transect
  lengths, area surveyed, etc.  Computes confidence intervals on
  abundance (or density) using a the bias corrected bootstrap method.
}
\details{
The abundance estimate for line-transect surveys (if no covariates
   are included in the detection function and both sides of the transect 
   are observed) is 
   \deqn{N =\frac{n(A)}{2(ESW)(L)}}{%
         N = n*A / (2*ESW*L)} 
   where \emph{n} is total number of sighted individuals 
  (i.e., \code{sum(groupSizes(dfunc))}), \emph{L} is the total length of 
  surveyed transect (i.e., \code{sum(effort(dfunc))}),
  and \emph{ESW} is effective strip width
  computed from the estimated distance function (i.e., \code{ESW(dfunc)}).
  If only one side of transects were observed, the "2" in the denominator 
  is not present (or, replaced with a "1"). 
  
  The abundance estimate for point transect surveys (if no covariates are
  included) is 
   \deqn{N =\frac{n(A)}{\pi(ESR^2)(P)}}{%
         N = n*A / ((3.1415)*ESR^2*(P))} 
   where \emph{n} is total number of sighted individuals (i.e., \code{sum(groupSizes(dfunc))}),
   \emph{P} is the total number of surveyed points (i.e., \code{sum(effort(dfunc))}), 
   and \emph{ESR} is effective search radius 
   computed from the estimated distance function (i.e., \code{ESR(dfunc)}).

 Setting \code{plot.bs=FALSE} and \code{showProgress=FALSE} 
    suppresses all intermediate output.  
    
 Estimation of site-specific density (e.g., on every transect) is accomplished by 
 \code{predict(x, type = "density")}, which returns a 
 tibble containing density and abundance on the area surveyed by every
 transect.
}
\section{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}{


  Rdistance's nested data frames (produced by \code{\link{RdistDf}})
  contain all information required to estimate bootstrap CIs. 
  To compute bootstrap CIs, Rdistance resamples, with replacement,
  the rows of the \code{$data} component contained in Rdistance 
  fitted models. Rdistance assumes each row of \code{$data} 
  contains one information on on transect.
  The \code{$data} component also contains 
  information on which observations go into the 
  detection functions, which should be counted as detected targets, 
  and which count toward transect length. 
  After resampling rows of \code{$data}, Rdistance 
  refits the distance function using non-missing distances, 
  recomputes the detected number of targets using non-missing 
  group sizes on transects with non-missing length, 
  and re-computes total transect length from transects 
  with non-missing lengths. 
  By default, \code{R} = 500 bootstrap iterations are 
  performed, after which bias
  corrected confidence intervals are computed (Manly, 1997, section 3.4).
  
  The distance function is not re-selected during bootstrap resampling. The 
  model of the input object is re-fitted every iteration.  
  
  During bootstrap iterations, the distance function can fail. 
  An iteration can fail for a two reasons:
  (1) no detections on the iteration, and (2) a bad configuration 
  of distances that push the distance function's parameters to their 
  limits. When an iteration fails, Rdistance 
  skips the iteration and effectively ignores the 
  failed iterations. 
  If the proportion of failed iterations is small 
  (less than 20% by default), the resulting abundance confidence interval 
  is probably valid and no warning is issued.  If the proportion of 
  non-convergent iterations 
  is not small (exceeds 20% by default), a warning is issued.  
  The warning can be modified  
  by re-setting the \code{Rdistance_maxBSFailPropForWarning} option. 
  Setting \code{options(Rdistance_masBSFailPropForWarning = 1.0)} will turn 
  off the warning. 
  Setting \code{options(Rdistance_masBSFailPropForWarning = 0.0)} will 
  warn if any iteration failed.  Results (density and effective 
  sampling distance) 
  from all successful iterations are contained in the  
  non-NA rows of data frame 'B' in the output object.
}

\section{Missing Transect Lengths}{


  Transect lengths can be missing in the RdistDf object. 
  Missing length transects are equivalent
  to 0 [m] transects and do not count toward total surveyed units
  nor to group sizes on these transects count toward total 
  detected individuals.  
  Use NA-length transects to include their associated distances 
  when estimating the distance function, but not when estimating abundance. 
  For example, this allows estimation of abundance on one 
  study area using off-transect distances from another.  This allows 
  sightability to be estimated using two or more similar targets (e.g., 
  two similar species), but abundance to be estimated separate for each 
  target type.
  Include NA-length transects by including the "extra" distance observations 
  in the detection data frame, with valid
  site IDs, but set the length of those site IDs to NA in the site data frame.
}

\section{Point Transect Lengths}{

  Point transects do not have a physical measurement for length. 
  The "length" of point transects is the number of points on the transect. 
  Point transects can contain only one point.  
  Rdistance treats transects of points as independent 
  and bootstrap resamples them to estimate variance. The number of points
  on each point transect must exist in the RdistDf and cannot have 
  physical measurement units (it is a count, not a distance).
