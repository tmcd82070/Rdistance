\usage{
abundEstim(
  dfunc,
  detectionData,
  siteData,

  ci = 0.95,
  R = 500,

}
\arguments{
\item{dfunc}{An estimated 'dfunc' object produced by \code{dfuncEstim}.}

\item{detectionData}{A data.frame with each row representing one detection
(see example dataset, \code{\link{sparrowDetectionData}}) and with at least
the following three columns: 
\itemize{ 
  \item \code{siteID} = ID of the transect or point. 
  \item \code{groupsize} = the number of individuals in the detected group. 
  \item \code{dist} = the perpendicular, off-transect distance or radial
    off-point distance to the detected group. 
}}

\item{siteData}{A data.frame with each row representing one site 
(transect or point) (see example dataset, 
\code{\link{sparrowSiteData}}). If the data in \code{detectionData}
is from line transects, \code{siteData} must have at 
least the following two columns:
\itemize{ 
  \item \code{siteID} = ID of the transect or point. This vector 
  is used during bootstrapping to resample sites. 
  \item \code{length} = the length of the transect. 
}
If the data in \code{detectionData}
is from point transects, \code{siteData} must have a
\code{siteID} column only.  For both data types, \code{siteID} 
  is used during bootstrapping to resample sites.}

\item{area}{Total study area size.  If \code{area} = 1, density is estimated.
Density has units (number of animals) per (squared 
units of the distance measurements).  For example, if distance values fitted
in \code{dfunc} are meters, density is number of individuals per
square meter.  If distances are miles, density is number of
individuals per square mile.  If \code{area} > 1, total abundance on the
study area is estimated and units are (number of animals).  This can also
be used to convert units for density. For example, if distance values fitted
in \code{dfunc} are meters, and area is set to 10,000, density is number
of individuals per hectare (ha; 1 ha = 10,000 square meters).
square meter.}

\item{ci}{A scalar indicating the confidence level of confidence intervals. 
Confidence intervals are computed using the bias corrected bootstrap
method. If \code{ci = NULL}, confidence intervals are not computed.}

\item{R}{The number of bootstrap iterations to conduct when \code{ci} is not
NULL.}

\item{plot.bs}{A logical scalar indicating whether to plot individual
bootstrap iterations.}

\item{bySite}{A logical scalar indicating whether to compute site-level
estimates of abundance. The default (\code{bySite=FALSE}) returns only one
overall abundance estimate. This routine does not calculate confidence
intervals for these site-level abundance estimates, so \code{ci} is set to
\code{NULL} if \code{bySite = TRUE}. See \code{\link{estimateN}}.}

\item{showProgress}{A logical indicating whether to show a text-based
progress bar during bootstrapping. Default is \code{TRUE}. 
It is handy to shut off the 
progress bar if running this within another function. Otherwise, 
it is handy to see progress of the bootstrap iterations.}
}
\value{
If \code{bySite} is FALSE, an 'abundance estimate' object, a list of
  class \code{c("abund", "dfunc")}, containing all the components of a "dfunc"
  object (see \code{dfuncEstim}), plus the following: 
  
 \item{abundance}{Estimated abundance in the study area (if \code{area} >
 1) or estimated density in the study area (if \code{area} = 1).}
  \item{n}{The number of detections
 (not individuals, unless all group sizes = 1) used in the estimate of
 abundance.}
  \item{area}{Total area of inference. Study area size}
  \item{esw}{Effective strip width for line-transects, effective
  radius for point-transects.  Both derived from \code{dfunc}. 
  See \code{\link{ESW}}} or \code{\link{EDR}} for formulas.
  \item{n.sites}{Total number of transects for line-transects, 
  total number of points for point-transects.}
  \item{tran.len}{Total transect length. NULL for point-transects.}
  \item{avg.group.size}{Average group size}
  \item{ci}{The bias corrected bootstrap confidence interval for
  \code{n.hat}.  The names of this component give the quantiles of the
  bootstrap distribution used to compute the bias corrected interval.} 
  \item{B}{A vector or length \code{R} containing all bootstrap estimated
  population sizes. If a particular iteration did not converge, the
  corresponding entry in \code{B} will be \code{NA}. The bootstrap
  distribution of \code{n.hat} can be plotted with \code{hist(x$B)}, where
  \code{x} is an 'abundance estimate' object. The confidence interval in
  \code{ci} can be reproduced with \code{quantile(x$B[!is.na(x$B)],
  p=names(x$ci) )}.}
  \item{nItersConverged}{The number of bootstrap iterations that converged.  }
  \item{alpha}{The (scalar) confidence level of the
  confidence interval for \code{n.hat}.} 
  
  If \code{bySite} is TRUE, a data frame containing site-level 
  estimated abundance.  The data frame is an exact copy of \code{siteData}
  with the following columns tacked onto the end:
   
  \item{effDist}{The effective sampling distance at the site.  For line-
  transects, this is ESW at the site.  For points, this is EDR. } 
  \item{pDetection}{Average probability of detection at the site. 
  If only site-level covariates appear in the distance function, 
  pDetection is constant within a site. When detection-level 
  covariates are present, pDetection is the average at the site.}
  \item{observedCount}{The total number of individuals detected at a site.}
  \item{abundance}{Estimated abundance at the site. This is the sum
  of inflated group sizes at the site. i.e., each group size 
  at the site is divided by its pDetection, and then summed.    }
  \item{density}{Estimated density at the site. This is abundance 
  at the site divided by the sampled area at the site.  E.g., for 
  line transects, this is abundance divided by \eqn{2*w*length}. For 
  points, this is abundance divided by \eqn{pi*w^2}.}
  \item{effArea}{The effective area sampled at the site. This could be used
  as an offset in a subsequent linear model. For 
  line transects, this is \eqn{2*ESW*length}. For 
  points, this is \eqn{pi*EDR^2}.}
}
\description{
Estimate abundance (or density) given an estimated detection
  function and supplemental information on observed group sizes, transect
  lengths, area surveyed, etc.  Also computes confidence intervals of
  abundance (or density) using the bias corrected bootstrap method.
}
\details{
The abundance estimate for line transect surveys (if no covariates
   are included in the detection function) is \deqn{N =
  \frac{n.indiv(area)}{2(ESW)(tot.trans.len)}}{N = n.indiv*area /
  (2*ESW*tot.trans.len)} where \code{n.indiv} is either \code{avg.group.size * n} or
  \code{sum(group.sizes)}, and \code{ESW} is the effective strip width
  computed from the estimated distance function (i.e., \code{ESW(dfunc)}).

 Setting \code{plot.bs=FALSE} and \code{showProgress=FALSE} 
    suppresses all intermediate output.  This is good when calling 
    \code{abundEstim} from within other functions or during simulations.

\section{Bootstrap Confidence Intervals}{


  The bootstrap confidence interval for abundance 
  assumes that the fundamental units of
  replication (lines or points, hereafter "sites") are independent.
  The bias corrected bootstrap
  method used here resamples the units of replication (sites), 
  refits the distance function, and estimates abundance using 
  the resampled counts and re-estimated distance function. 
  If a double-observer data
  frame is included in \code{dfunc}, rows of the double-observer data frame
  are re-sampled each bootstrap iteration. 
  
  This routine does not 
  re-select the distance model fitted to resampled data.  The 
  model in the input object is re-fitted every iteration.  
  
  By default, \code{R} = 500 iterations are performed, after which the bias
  corrected confidence intervals are computed (Manly, 1997, section 3.4).
  
  During bootstrap iterations, the distance function can fail 
  to converge on the resampled data.   An iteration can fail 
  to converge for a two reasons:
  (1) no detections on the iteration, and (2) bad configuration 
  of distances on the iteration which pushes parameters to their 
  bounds. When an iteration fails to produce a valid 
  distance function, \code{Rdistance} 
  uses the last convergent distance function to estimate 
  abundance on the iteration rather than ignore these 
  non-convergent iterations and continue. This approach includes 
  all variation associated with counts, but may not include 
  all the variation associated with distance function estimation.  
  If the proportion of non-convergent iterations is small 
  (less than 20% by default), the resulting confidence interval 
  on abundance is 
  probably valid.  If the proportion of non-convergent iterations 
  is not small (exceeds 20% by default), a warning is issued.  
  The print method (\code{print.abund}) is the routine that  issues this 
  warning. The warning can be 
  turned off by setting \code{maxBSFailPropForWarning} in the 
  print method to 1.0, or by modifying the code in \code{RdistanceControls()}
  to re-set the default threshold and storing the modified 
  function in your \code{.GlobalEnv}.
