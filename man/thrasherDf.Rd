\title{Sage Thrasher detection data frame in Rdistance >4.0.0 format}
\format{
A rowwise tibble containing 120 rows and 8 columns, one of which 
(i.e., 'detections') contains nested data frames of detections.  
Each row represents
one transect of one point.

A data.frame containing 120 rows and 6 columns.  Each row represents
a surveyed site.  Each surveyed site is considered one transect of one point.  
Column descriptions: 
\enumerate{ 
\item \code{siteID}: Factor (120 levels), the site or point surveyed.  
\item \code{detections}: An embedded (nested) data frame containing 
detections made at that point.  Columns in the embedded data frame contain:
  \enumerate{
    \item \code{groupsize}: The number of individuals in
    the detected group.  
    \item \code{dist}: The radial distance (m) from
    the transect to the detected group.  
  }
\item \code{observer}: Factor (six levels), identity of the observer who surveyed
the point.  
\item \code{bare}: Number, the mean bare ground cover (\%)
within 100 m of each point.  
\item \code{herb}: Number, the mean herbaceous
cover (\%) within 100 m of each point.  
\item \code{shrub}: Number, the mean
shrub cover (\%) within 100 m of each point.  
\item \code{height}: Number,
the mean shrub height (cm) within 100 m of each point.  
\item \code{npoints}: The number of point counts on the transect.

The sage thrasher data are a subset of data collected 
by Jason Carlisle and various field technicians for his Ph.D. from the 
Department of Ecology, University of Wyoming, in 2017.  This portion of 
Jason's work was funded by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department 
through agreements 
with the University of Wyoming's  Cooperative Fish & Wildlife
Research Unit (2012).
