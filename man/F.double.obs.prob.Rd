\title{Compute double observer probability of detection (No external covariates allowed)}
\usage{
F.double.obs.prob(df, observer = "both")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A data frame containing the components \code{$obsby.1} and \code{$obsby.2}.
These components are either 0/1 (0 = missed, 1 = seen) or TRUE/FALSE (logical) vectors indicating whether
observer 1 (\code{obsby.1}) or observer 2 (\code{obsby.2}) spotted the target. There is 
no flexibility 
on naming these columns of \code{df}.  They must be named \code{$obsby.1} and \code{$obsby.2}.}

\item{observer}{A number of text string indicating the primary observer.  Primary observers can be 
observer 1, or observer 2, or "both".
If, for example, observer 2 was a data recorder and part-time observer, or if observer 2
was the pilot, set \code{observer} = 1.  This dictates which set of observations form the denominator
of the double observer system.  For example, if \code{observer} = 1, observations by observer 1 that were not seen
by observer 2 are ignored. The estimate in this case uses targets seen by both observers and
those seen by observer 2 but not observer 1. If observer = "both", the denominator is computed twice, once 
assuming observer 1 was the primary, once assuming observer 2 was the primary, and then computes 
the probability of one or more observers sighting a target.}
}
\value{
A single scalar, the probability of detection estimate.
}
\description{
Estimates the probability of detection in a two-observer system when observations are independent.
}
\details{
When \code{observer} = "both", the observers are assumed to be independent. In this case the estimate 
  of detection is 
  \deqn{p = p_1 + p_2 - p_1p_2}{p = p1 + p2 - p1*p2}  
  where \eqn{p_1}{p1} is the proportion of targets seen by observer 2 that were also seen by observer 1, 
  \eqn{p_2}{p2} is the proportion of targets seen by observer 1 that were also seen by observer 2.
  This estimator is very close to unbiased when observers are actually independent.
