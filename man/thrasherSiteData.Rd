\enumerate{ 
\item \code{siteID}: Factor (120 levels), the site or point surveyed.  
\item \code{observer}: Factor (six levels), identity of the observer who surveyed
the point.  
\item \code{bare}: Number, the mean bare ground cover (\%)
within 100 m of each point.  
\item \code{herb}: Number, the mean herbaceous
cover (\%) within 100 m of each point.  
\item \code{shrub}: Number, the mean
shrub cover (\%) within 100 m of each point.

The Sage Thrasher data are a subset of data collected 
by Jason Carlisle and field technicians for his Ph.D. from the 
Department of Ecology, University of Wyoming, in 2017.  This portion of 
Jason's work was funded by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department through agreements 
with the University of Wyoming's  Cooperative Fish & Wildlife
Research Unit (2012).
