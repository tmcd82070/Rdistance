\title{Effective sampling distances}
\usage{
effectiveDistance(object, newdata = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{An Rdistance model frame or fitted distance function,
normally produced by a call to \code{\link{dfuncEstim}}.}

\item{newdata}{A data frame containing new values for 
covariates at which either
ESW's or EDR's will be computed. If NULL and 
  \code{object} contains covariates, the  
  covariates stored in
  \code{object} are used (like \code{\link{predict.lm}}).
  If not NULL, covariate values in \code{newdata}
  are used. 
  See \bold{Value} section for more information.}
}
\value{
If \code{newdata} is present, the returned value is 
a vector of effective sampling distances associated with 
covariate values in \code{newdata}. Length of return 
in this case is the number of rows in \code{newdata}. 
If \code{newdata} is NULL, the returned value is a vector 
of effective sampling distances associated with covariate 
values in \code{object}. Length of return in this case 
is the number of detected groups.  The returned vector 
has measurement units, i.e., \code{object$outputUnits}.
}
\description{
Computes Effective Strip Width (ESW) for line-transect detection
  functions, or the analogous Effective Detection Radius (EDR) for point-transect
  detection functions.
}
\details{
Serves as a wrapper for 
\code{\link{ESW}} and \code{\link{EDR}}.

Effective distances are areas under scaled 
distance functions (i.e., area under g(x)). Areas are 
exact for functions whose integral is known (e.g., negexp). 
Numeric integration is used for all others.
