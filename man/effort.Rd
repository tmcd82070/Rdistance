\title{effort - Effort information}
\usage{
effort(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Either an estimated distance function, output by 
\code{dfuncEstim}, or an Rdistance nested data frame, output by 
\code{RdistDf}.}

\item{...}{Ignored}
}
\value{
A vector containing effort. If line-transects, return is 
length of transects, with units.  If point-transects, return is 
number of points (integers, no units).  Vector length is
number of transects. If input is not an RdistDf or estimated distance
function, return is NULL.
}
\description{
Extract effort information from an Rdistance data frame. Effort is 
length of line-transects or number of points on point-transects.
}
\examples{

sparrowDf <- RdistDf(sparrowSiteData, sparrowDetectionData)
effort(sparrowDf)
fit <- dfuncEstim(sparrowDf, dist ~ 1)
effort(fit)
