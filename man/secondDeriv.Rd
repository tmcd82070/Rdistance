\usage{
secondDeriv(x, FUN, eps = 1e-08, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{The location (a vector) where the second derivatives 
of \code{FUN} are desired.}

\item{FUN}{An R function for which the second derivatives are 
sought.  
This must be a function of the form FUN <- function(x, ...){...}
where x is a vector of variable parameters to FUN at which 
to evaluate the 2nd derivative, 
and ... are additional parameters needed to evaluate the function.
FUN must return a single value (scalar), the height of the 
surface above \code{x}, i.e., FUN evaluated at x.}

\item{eps}{A vector of small relative 
distances to add to \code{x} 
when evaluating derivatives.   This determines the '\eqn{dx}' of 
the numerical derivatives.  That is, the function 
is evaluated at \code{x}, \code{x+dx}, and \code{x+2*dx}, where 
\eqn{dx} = \code{x*eps^0.25}, in order to compute the second 
derivative. 
\code{eps} defaults to 1e-8 for all 
dimensions which equates to setting \eqn{dx} to one percent
of each \code{x} (i.e., by default the function is 
evaluate at \code{x}, \code{1.01*x} and \code{1.02*x} 
to compute the second derivative).  

One might want to change \code{eps} if the scale 
of dimensions in \code{x} varies wildly (e.g., kilometers and millimeters), 
or if changes between 
\code{FUN(x)} and \code{FUN(x*1.01)} are below machine precision.
If length of \code{eps} is less than length of \code{x},
\code{eps} is replicated to the length of \code{x}.}

\item{\dots}{Any arguments passed to \code{FUN}.}
}
\description{
Computes numeric second derivatives (hessian) of an 
arbitrary multidimensional function at a particular location.
}
\details{
This function uses the "5-point" numeric second derivative 
method advocated in numerous numerical recipe texts.  During computation
of the 2nd derivative, FUN must be 
capable of being evaluated at numerous locations within a hyper-ellipsoid 
with cardinal radii 2*\code{x}*(\code{eps})^0.25 = 0.02*\code{x} at the 
default value of \code{eps}.   

A handy way to use this function is to call an optimization routine 
like \code{nlminb} with FUN, then call this function with the 
optimized values (solution) and FUN.  This will yield the hessian 
at the solution and this is can produce a better 
estimate of the variance-covariance
matrix than using the hessian returned by some optimization routines. 
Some optimization routines return the hessian evaluated 
at the next-to-last step of optimization. 

An estimate of the variance-covariance matrix, which is used in 
\code{Rdistance}, is \code{solve(hessian)} where \code{hessian} is
\code{secondDeriv(<parameter estimates>, <likelihood>)}.

\examples{

func <- function(x){-x*x} # second derivative should be -2
secondDeriv(0,func)
secondDeriv(3,func)

func <- function(x){3 + 5*x^2 + 2*x^3} # second derivative should be 10+12x
secondDeriv(0,func)
secondDeriv(2,func)

func <- function(x){x[1]^2 + 5*x[2]^2} # should be rbind(c(2,0),c(0,10))
secondDeriv(c(1,1),func)
