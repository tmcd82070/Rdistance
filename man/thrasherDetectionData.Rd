\title{Sage Thrasher detection data}
\format{
A data.frame containing 193 rows and 3 columns.  Each row represents
a detected group of thrashers.  Column descriptions: 
\enumerate{ 
  \item \code{siteID}: Factor (120 levels), the site or point where the detection
  was made.  
  \item \code{groupsize}: Number, the number of individuals within
  the detected group.  
  \item \code{dist}: Number, the radial distance (m) from
  the transect to the detected group.  This is the distance used in analysis.

The Sage Thrasher data are a subset of the data collected 
by Jason Carlisle and various field technicians for his Ph.D. from the 
Department of Ecology, University of Wyoming, in 2017.  This portion of 
Jason's work was funded by the Wyoming Game and Fish Department through agreements 
with the University of Wyoming's  Cooperative Fish & Wildlife
Research Unit (2012).
