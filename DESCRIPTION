Description: Distance-sampling (Buckland et al., (2015) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-19219-2>) 
  estimates density and abundance of survey targets (e.g., animals) when 
  detection declines as distance from observer to target increases. 
  Distance-sampling is popular in ecology, 
  especially when survey targets are observed from aerial platforms (e.g., 
  airplane or drone), surface vessels (e.g., boat or truck), or along 
  walking transects. 
  Distance-sampling includes line-transect studies that measure observation 
  distances as the closest approach of the sample route (transect) to target 
  (i.e., perpendicular off-transect distance), and point-transect studies that 
  measure observation distances from stationary observers to 
  the target (i.e., radial distance). 
  These routines fit smooth curves to histograms of observation distances 
  and use those functions to compute effective sampling distances, density of 
  targets in the surveyed area, and abundance 
  of targets in a surrounding study area. Possible curve shapes include several 
  parametric functions (i.e., half-normal, hazard rate, logisitc, Gamma, 
  and negative exponential).
  Non-parametric smoothed density estimates are also included. Physical 
  measurement units are required on all distance and area parameters, which 
  ensure measurement unit integrity of outputs. The help files and 
  vignettes have been vetted by multiple authors and tested in workshop 
  settings.
