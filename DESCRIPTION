Description: Distance-sampling (<doi:10.1007/978-3-319-19219-2>) 
  estimates density and abundance of survey targets (e.g., animals) when 
  detection probability declines as distance from observer increases. 
  Distance-sampling is popular in ecology, 
  especially when survey targets are observed from aerial platforms (e.g., 
  airplane or drone), surface vessels (e.g., boat or truck), or along 
  walking transects. 
  Distance-sampling includes line-transect studies that measure observation 
  distances as the closest approach of the sample route (transect) to target 
  (i.e., perpendicular off-transect distance), and point-transect studies that 
  measure observation distances from stationary observers to 
  the target (i.e., radial distance). 
  The routines included here fit smooth (parametric) curves to 
  histograms of observation distances 
  and use those functions to compute effective sampling distances, density of 
  targets in the surveyed area, and abundance 
  of targets in a surrounding study area. Fitted curves include the 
  half-normal, hazard rate, and negative exponential functions.
  Physical measurement units are required and used throughout to 
  ensure reported density units are reported correctly. The help files 
  are extensive and have been vetted by multiple authors.
