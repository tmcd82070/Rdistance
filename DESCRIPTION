Description: Distance-sampling analyses (Buckland et al., (2015) <doi:10.1007/978-3-319-19219-2>) 
  estimate density and abundance of survey targets (e.g., animals) when 
  detection declines with distance. Distance-sampling is popular ecology, 
  especially when survey targets are observed from aerial platforms (e.g., 
  airplane or drone), surface vessels (e.g., boat or truck), or along 
  walking transects. Both point and line transects can be analyzed. Outputs 
  include overall (study area) density and abundance, effective sampling 
  distances, and model fit statistics. A large suite of classical, parametric 
  detection functions (e.g., half-normal, hazard rate) is included along 
  with uncommon parametric functions (e.g., Gamma, negative exponential).
  Non-parametric smoothed distance functions are included. Measurement unit 
  integrity is enforced via internal unit conversion. The help files and 
  vignettes have been vetted by multiple authors and tested in workshop 
  settings.
