Description: Distance-sampling (<doi:10.1007/978-3-319-19219-2>) 
  estimates density and abundance of survey targets (e.g., animals) when 
  detection probability declines with observation distance. 
  Distance-sampling is popular in ecology, 
  especially when survey targets are observed from aerial platforms (e.g., 
  airplane or drone), surface vessels (e.g., boat or truck), or along 
  walking transects. 
  Survey protocols include both line-transect and point-transect methods.
  Line-transect methods measure distance from target to
  closest approach of the sample route (i.e., perpendicular off-transect
  distances).  
  Point-transect methods measure distance from target to
  stationary observers (i.e., radial distances). 
  In short, Rdistance fits smooth (parametric) curves to 
  histograms of observation distances 
  and use those functions to compute effective sampling distances, density of 
  targets in the surveyed area, and abundance 
  of targets in a surrounding study area. 
  Physical measurement units are required and used throughout. 
  The help files are extensive and have been vetted by multiple authors.
