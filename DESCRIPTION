Description: Distance-sampling is a popular method for abundance estimation in
  ecology. This package contains functions and associated routines to analyze
  distance-sampling data collected on point or line transects. 
  Line and point transect analayses are accomodated in one routine 
  that accepts a regression-like formula object. Abundance routines
  perform automated bootstrapping and automated detection-function 
  selection. Overall (study area) and site-level (transect or point) 
  abundance estimates are
  available. A large suite of classical, parametric detection functions are 
  included.  Some uncommon (e.g., Gamma, negative exponential) 
  detection functions are also included and users can define 
  their own custom detection functions if needed. One form of 
  non-parametric smoothed distance function is included. 
  The help files and vignettes have been 
  vetted by multiple authors and tested in multiple workshop 
  settings.
